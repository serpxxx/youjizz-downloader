## Why YouJizz Downloader

YouJizz pages can expose different playback sources depending on the page state, player config, and available encodings. Generic downloaders often grab the wrong asset, miss the real video source, or fail once the site serves multiple variants from the same page.

YouJizz Downloader is designed to simplify that. It uses multi-source detection to find streams from flashvars, HTML5 video elements, and media API endpoints. Start the video, let the extension detect the active media source, then export the supported stream as MP4 without leaving the browser.

## Features

- Detects supported YouJizz video sources from active pages
- Multi-source detection covering flashvars, HTML5 video, and media API
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Handles direct-file and supported player-backed download flows
- Converts HLS streams to standard MP4 files in-browser
- Lists available quality variants when multiple encodings exist
- Right-click context menu for quick downloads
- Exports MP4 files for easier offline playback
- Auto-saves to an organized YouJizz subfolder in Downloads
- Works on Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## How It Works

1. Install the extension from the latest release.
2. Open a YouJizz video page and press play.
3. Let the extension detect the active media source.
4. Open the popup or use the in-page download button on the player.
5. Select the quality you want from the available resolutions.
6. Start the download and wait for the MP4 export to finish.
7. Save the finished file locally.

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect the video**  
Press play first and wait for the page to initialize the active source.

**Only one quality is listed**  
Some pages expose only one usable source, so no extra picker appears.

**The wrong source was detected**
Refresh the page, start playback again, and retry after the player fully loads.

**The download failed partway through**
Check your connection and refresh the page before starting again.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.

## Installation Instructions

1. Open the latest release page: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/serpapps/youjizz-downloader/releases/latest)
2. Download the build for your browser.
3. Install the extension.
4. Open a YouJizz video page.
5. Use the popup to detect and download the media.

## FAQ

**Can I download YouJizz videos as MP4?**  
Yes. Supported downloads are exported as MP4 files.

**Do I need extra software?**  
No. The workflow stays inside the browser extension.
